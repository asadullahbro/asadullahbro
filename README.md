## Hey there, I'm Asadullah 👋

Welcome to my lil corner of the internet where i break code, fix it, then break it again for fun

## About me
• python enjoyer  
• building bots and random tools  
• sqlite + backend experiments  
• always trying to make things look cooler than they actually are (maybe in hours?)

## What I'm working on right now
• discord bot features  
• random python scripts that accidentally turn into full projects  
• Some E-commerce project :)

## Languages and tools

## Random quote of the day
> if the code works dont touch it  
> if it doesnt work also dont touch it  
> stare at it until it magically fixes itself
